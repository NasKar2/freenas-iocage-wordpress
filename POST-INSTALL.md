## Manual Post-Installation Tasks
To complete the following tasks, use a terminal to connect to the jail `iocage console wordpress`.

1. Securing MariaDB
2. Authentication Unique Keys and Salts
3. Configure WordPress for Reverse Proxy
4. Setup the WordPress Filesystem
5. Configure sSMTP
6. Test sSMTP

There is the opportunity to incorporate some of the above within the WordPress script. For more information, refer to the blog post [WordPress Script: Opportunities for Improvement](https://blog.udance.com.au/2020/09/20/wordpress-script-opportunities-for-improvement/).

### Securing MariaDB
Note the DB root password `cat /root/wordpress_db_password.txt`.

Run the script `/usr/local/bin/mysql_secure_installation`.

### Authentication Unique Keys and Salts
Click on https://api.wordpress.org/secret-key/1.1/salt/ and then replace the relevant section in `wp-config.php`:

`cd /usr/local/www/wordpress && ee wp-config.php`

### Configure WordPress for Reverse Proxy
Add these line to the top of the file `wp-config.php`  below `<?php`.
```
define('FORCE_SSL_ADMIN', true); 
if (strpos($_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO'], 'https') !== false)
  $_SERVER['HTTPS']='on';
```

### Setup the WordPress Filesystem
Find the line `define('DB_PASSWORD', 'password');` in the file `wp-config.php` and paste the following line below it.

`define('FS_METHOD', 'direct');`

### Configure sSMTP
First, edit the file  `/etc/mail/mailer.conf`:

`cd /etc/mail && ee mailer.conf`

Locate the following lines:
```
sendmail        /usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail
mailq           /usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail
newaliases      /usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail
hoststat        /usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail
purgestat       /usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail
```
Change these lines to:
```
sendmail        /usr/local/sbin/ssmtp
send-mail       /usr/local/sbin/ssmtp
mailq           /usr/local/sbin/ssmtp
newaliases      /usr/local/sbin/ssmtp
hoststat        /usr/bin/true
purgestat       /usr/bin/true
```
Now edit the file `/usr/local/etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf`:

`cd /usr/local/etc/ssmtp && ee ssmtp.conf`

Enter your configuration details in the `ssmtp.conf` file. Modify this example to fit your situation:
```
MailHub=mail.example.com:465     # Mail server to connect to (port 465 is SMTP/SSL)
UseTLS=YES                       # Enable SSL/TLS 
AuthUser=john                    # Username for SMTP AUTH
AuthPass=Secret1                 # Password for SMTP AUTH 
FromLineOverride=YES             # Force the From: address to the user account 
Hostname=myhost.example.com      # Name of this host 
RewriteDomain=myhost.example.com # Where the mail will seem to come from 
Root=postmaster                  # Mail for root@ is redirected to postmaster@
```

### Test sSMTP
Create a txt file `ee test.txt` with the following text, but remember to alter the email addresses.
```
To: yourmail@gmail.com 
From: yourmail@gmail.com 
Subject: Testmessage 
This is a test for sending
```
Run the command:

`ssmtp -v yourmail@gmail.com < test.txt`

Status messages should indicated that the mail was sent successfully. If there are no errors, you can then check out `yourmail@gmail.com` and make sure that email has been delivered successfully. But, if you do get errors and don't receive the email then check `/var/log/maillog`:

`cat /var/log/maillog`

## Configure the Reverse Proxy
If using Caddy, the code block might look something like:
```
blog.mydomain.com {
  encode gzip
  reverse_proxy http://10.1.1.4
}
```

## Set up WordPress
You're now ready to do the famous five-minute WordPress installation. Do this by entering your WordPress site FQDN in a browser e.g. https://blog.mydomain.com
